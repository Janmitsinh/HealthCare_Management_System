# HealthCare_Management_System
Goal: - The goal of a Distributed Health Care Management System (DHMS) is to manage  medical appointments

Here, we have two types of users of the system:
1] By Hospital admins: - Admins use DHMS to manage the information about medical 
appointments. To perform add, remove, list appointment and also patient actions.
2] By Patients: - Patients use DHMS to book, cancel and get Appointment Schedules across 
different hospitals within the Medicare System.


Important/Difficult Part of this Assignment: -
1. Implementing Java RMI: Need to design and implement the Java RMI interface for the 
server and ensure that remote access calls between the client and the server are handled 
correctly and reliably.
2. Managing distributed data: Need to manage appointment records in HashMap, 
ensuring consistency and consistency of data for multiple servers for different cities 
(Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke). This requires an understanding of data structures.
3. Inter-Server Communication: Use functionality for servers to communicate with each 
other, using UDP/IP sockets, especially for applications such as booking appointments with 
hospitals.
